# Winols-Astra-VXR
My own 2017 project I wanted to master done with curiosity of the lines of code within a .bin file of many modern day ecu engine control units. So called secrets wizardry of ecu remappers many of which dont even understand the code themselves !!! 

Current modern control units vary many manufacturers code including hardware and software varies so I have narrowed my research into bosch motronic me ecu

Ecu remapping vauxhall vehicles via obd2 port read and write the .bin using kess v2 hardware 
and software learning using winols and damos packs

Managed the horrible task of reverse engineering 4200 lines of code then translated the map descriptors from german to english to be able to understand every single line of code inside a astra vxr bosch 7.6.2 me ecu and also be able to change any functions of the engine control unit 

Success after many hours of persistance we tested my modified code on my friend steve davis astra vxr we went for a rolling road dyno readout in 2022 and was better than a stage 1 remap we was both impressed with the results. 

I will upload the ori .bin and also the modified bin a few pics of the modified code the car and dyno sheet later along with hw and sw numbers

They are hardware number specific so do not think they are for every astra vxr as for this hardware variant only do not flash your ecu unless you know what you are doing easy to end up with a brick as silly as leaving the radio on and or not connecting a battery charger to keep a stable voltage things can go horribly wrong very easy warning to people never done this before can you cover the cost of a replacement ecu in the event of a brick and do you know how to use mdi tool to reprogram the said vehicle immobiliser functions i would personally avoid doing this without at least if you havent access to main dealer mdi tool !!!!! beware
